* Session Title: Strategies for getting the most out of TDD 
* Preferred Timeframe: August
* Event Type: [50 Minute Lecture]
* Summary: We learn Test Driven development through katas and as a way to acheive test coverage; but we tend to ignore its real benefits: Helping us explore problem spaces, determining the shape and feel of our APIs through tests, and lowering coupling and increasing cohesion.  Standing in our way are how we've been taught to TDD and our frameworks.  This talk will give an overview of the problems we face when trying to TDD production code and stratgies we can use to make it easier.

## Proposed Topic

We learn Test Driven development through katas and as a way to acheive test coverage; but we tend to ignore its real benefits: Helping us explore problem spaces, determining the shape and feel of our APIs through tests, and lowering coupling and increasing cohesion.  Standing in our way are how we've been taught to TDD and our frameworks.
